### _Anomaly Detection in Federated Learning: A Comparative Analysis of TRIM and RONI_

## **Project Overview**

This repository contains the report and presentation for the project titled **"Anomaly Detection in Federated Learning: A Comparative Analysis of TRIM and RONI."**

The study explores the vulnerabilities of Federated Learning (FL) systems to poisoning attacks and evaluates two anomaly detection methods, TRIM and RONI, for their effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability in mitigating such adversarial threats.
